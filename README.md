# AgentForge Studio

Self-hosted AgentOps studio for building, running, tracing, approving, evaluating, and extending multi-agent AI workflows.

AgentForge Studio is a full-stack portfolio project, not a mock landing page. It includes a Next.js dashboard, FastAPI backend, SQLAlchemy persistence, queue-aware execution path, reusable Agent Pack YAML format, tool runtime, policy guardrails, human approval queue, trace timeline, memory indexing, and rule-based evaluation lab.

## About

Most agent demos hardcode one prompt chain. AgentForge Studio is built around **Agent Packs**: portable YAML definitions that describe agents, workflow graph, tools, memory behavior, policies, and evaluation cases. The goal is to make multi-agent systems inspectable, repeatable, testable, and safer to operate locally.

The app ships with five working packs:

- Research Team
- Customer Feedback Intelligence Team
- Coding Review Team
- Document Review Team
- Sales Outreach Team

## Proof It Runs

The screenshots below were captured from the running application on June 26, 2026 using the included screenshot capture script.

Validation performed locally:

| Check | Result |
|---|---:|
| Backend compile | Passed |
| Agent Pack validation | 5 packs passed |
| Backend tests | 10 passed |
| Local evaluation smoke test | 5/5 passed |
| Frontend production build | Passed |
| UI screenshot capture | 12 screenshots saved |

Notes:

- The demo screenshots use SQLite, sync queue mode, and the mock LLM provider so the project can run without Docker, Redis, or API keys.
- Docker Compose deployment is included for PostgreSQL, Redis, backend, worker, frontend, and optional Ollama.
- `npm audit` currently reports two moderate PostCSS advisories through Next.js. The critical Next.js advisories were removed by upgrading to Next `15.5.19`.

## System Architecture

AgentForge Studio has four main layers:

| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Next.js dashboard | Operator UI for packs, workflow graph, runs, traces, approvals, tools, memory, evals, and settings |
| FastAPI backend | REST API, WebSocket events, pack validation, database models, seeding, health checks, metrics |
| Agent runtime | Agent Pack parser, workflow runner, provider abstraction, policy engine, trace writer, evaluator |
| Infrastructure | PostgreSQL or SQLite, Redis/RQ queue, worker process, local storage, Docker Compose |

## Quick Start

### Docker Compose

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

API docs:

```text
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

Stop and remove local volumes:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

### Local Lightweight Mode

Use this when Docker, Redis, or PostgreSQL are not available.

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

PYTHONPATH=. \
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./agentforge.db \
QUEUE_EXECUTION_MODE=sync \
LLM_PROVIDER=mock \
python -m uvicorn backend.app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

In another terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 npm run dev
```

## Useful Commands

```bash
python -m py_compile backend/app/main.py
python scripts/validate_packs.py
pytest backend/tests -q
python evals/run_local_eval.py
docker compose config
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
npm run screenshots
```

## Screenshot Capture

Screenshots are reproducible through Playwright and the installed browser on the machine.

```bash
cd frontend
APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000 API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 npm run screenshots
```

Saved files are written to:

```text
docs/screenshots/
```

## Agent Pack Example

```yaml
name: "Research Team"
version: "1.0.0"
description: "Multi-agent research workflow with source verification and report writing."
models:
  default_provider: "openai_compatible"
  default_model: "gpt-4o-mini"
agents:
  - id: "planner"
    name: "Planner Agent"
    role: "Breaks user request into subtasks"
    goal: "Create a clear plan for other agents"
    tools: []
workflow:
  type: "supervisor_workers"
  start: "planner"
  nodes: ["planner", "researcher", "critic", "writer"]
  edges:
    - from: "planner"
      to: "researcher"
tools:
  - "file_reader"
  - "web_search"
  - "markdown_report"
  - "memory.search"
policies:
  require_approval:
    - "web_search"
  blocked:
    - "secret.read"
evaluation:
  cases_file: "eval_cases.json"
```

## Security Model

Implemented local safeguards:

- API keys stay backend-side and are never exposed to the frontend.
- Dangerous tools can be blocked by policy.
- Risky tools can require human approval before execution.
- Email and GitHub tools produce drafts instead of performing destructive actions.
- Tool calls, approval decisions, and policy checks are written to trace spans.
- Uploaded filenames are sanitized.
- File upload size is configurable.
- Runs have step and cost guardrails.
- Code execution uses a constrained Python subprocess timeout.
- Current no-auth mode is for trusted local development only.

Planned hardening:

- Authentication and RBAC
- Workspace isolation
- Secrets manager integration
- Stronger sandboxing for code execution
- Rate limiting and audit export
- Multi-user deployment mode
